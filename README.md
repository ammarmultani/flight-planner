# flight-planner
Created an object orientated program in Java that determines all possible flight plans for a person wishing to travel between two different cities serviced by an airline (assuming a path exists). Also it calculates the total cost incurred for all parts of the trip. This code had used two different input files, an origination/destination one and requested flights. The input file for flight data will represent a sequence of origin/destination city pairs with a cost of that flight. The first line of the input file will contain an integer which indicates the total number of origin/destination pairs contained in the file. It required linked lists for each distinct city.
